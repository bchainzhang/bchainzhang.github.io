## Summer school for incoming graduates

I have multiple openings for graduate students and PhD students. Please submit the form <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/l8-emfhmlWY9j3yiFc8wBA">here</a>. 

Students with computer science background or cryptography or security background are encouraged to apply! 

## Short Bio

Haibin Zhang is interested in the intersection of distributed systems, applied cryptography, and security. 

Haibin Zhang is a Professor in the prestigious <a href="https://arims.bit.edu.cn/">Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Sciences</a> at Beijing Institute of Technology, China. Haibin is a Teli Youth Fellow. 

Haibin Zhang is also a PhD advisor in both School of Computer Science and Technology and School of Cyberspace Science and Technology. 

Previously, he worked as a Chief Research Scientist at Shandong Institute of Blockchain (China), an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (USA), and a postdoctoral researcher for two NSF frontier projects on cloud security: the MACS project at UConn (with Prof. Marten van Dijk) and the Project Silver at UNC Chapel Hill (with Prof. Michael K. Reiter). Haibin received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis (with Prof. Matthew K. Franklin). 

He received the best paper candidate award at the 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems and proved the security of a NIST standard on ciphertext 
stealing. Haibin is one of the main inventors of Norton Zone, Symantecâ€™s scalable cloud storage, and BChain, a highly efficient BFT protocol fully implemented within Hyperledger blockchain framework and featured in more 20 media reports, including the Hyperledger whitepaper. Haibin has received Maryland Innovation Award and research funding from NSF, DoE, DHS, Norway research council, etc.  

## Recent conferences in which I am invovled as PCs (please submit your beautiful work!): 

<a href="https://sites.uclouvain.be/OPODIS2022/">OPODIS 2022</a> (please submit your papers to conference!)

<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2023-call-for-papers/">NDSS 2023</a> 

ACM CCSW 2022 

<a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~yanwang/ieee-mass-2022/Home.html">IEEE MASS 2023</a> 

<a href="https://icdcs2022.icdcs.org/">ICDCS 2022</a>    

I am happy to serve as PC members and spend time in helping review papers. 
More importantly, I really want to advertise and promote international conferences in China, 
and help exchange academic ideas and advance knowledge. (The world is somewhat more disconneted due to COVID. No?:)) 


I am certainly biased, but I am particularly interested and committed in promoting less established but high-quality conferences in China. 
Doing so may help these conferences more vigorous (e.g., by receiving 
more high-quality submissions), help researchers in China have more balanced research 
(now somewhat impacted by the CCF short list---some of those conferences not in the list, unfornately, are ones with areas that are under-developed), 
and help researchers who published papers in these conferences get the recognization that they deserve.  


## Some BFT/permissioned blockchain systems built
ByzID (SRDS 2014, Best Paper Candidate, BFT using small trusted components)<br>

BChain (OPODIS 2014, chain-based high-throughput BFT, used in Hyperledger Iroha, featured in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf">Hyperledger white paper</a>. In fact, this is the only BFT protocol that does not rely on PBFT in the Hyperledger framework.)

CBFT (SRDS 2016, BFT with confidentiality; if you want to achieve private smart contracts without using TEEs, you may be interested in the paper)

CP-BFT (DSN 2017, BFT with causal order without using threshold cryptography)

BEAT (CCS 2018, asynchronous BFT made practical; a family of five state-of-the-art asychronous BFT protocols; open-source implementation [<a href="https://github.com/fififish/beat.git">Code</a>] See review from  <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/11/26/beat-asynchronous-bft-made-practical/">Morning Paper</a>)

EPIC (DSN 2020, asynchronous BFT with adaptive security. Prior asynchronous BFT protocols defend against static adversary, while EPIC tolerates adaptive adversary. Code to be released soon)

<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/020">PACE (CCS 2022)</a> and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/021">WaterBear</a> are two new asynchronous BFT protocols

Recently, I am interested in building highly efficient partially synchronous BFT protocols (e.g., our DSN 2022 paper---Marlin, our Oakland Paper---Dyno). Stay tuned!


## Openings!
I have many openings for PhDs, masters, and postdocs. Please do not hesitate to send me an email if you are interested in working with me. 

We also welcome researchers and assistant professors to join our group and work together with us.
