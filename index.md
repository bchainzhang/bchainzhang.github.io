## Short Bio



I am a professor in the prestigious <a href="https://arims.bit.edu.cn/">Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Sciences</a> at Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I am also a PhD advisor in both School of Computer Science and Technology and School of Cyberspace Science and Technology. Moreover, I am a Teli Youth Fellow. 

I am interested in the intersection of distributed systems, applied cryptography, and security. 

Previously, I worked as a Chief Research Scientist at Shandong Institute of Blockchain (China), an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at University of Maryland, Baltimore County (USA), and a postdoctoral researcher for two NSF frontier projects on cloud security: the MACS project at UConn (with Prof. Marten van Dijk) and the Project Silver at UNC Chapel Hill (with Prof. Michael K. Reiter). I received his Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis (with Prof. Matthew K. Franklin). 

I received the best paper candidate award at the 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems and proved the security of a NIST standard on ciphertext 
stealing. I am one of the main inventors of Norton Zone, Symantecâ€™s scalable cloud storage, and BChain, a highly efficient BFT protocol fully implemented within Hyperledger blockchain framework and featured in more 20 media reports, including the Hyperledger whitepaper. I have received Maryland Innovation Award and research funding from NSF China, the Ministry of Science and Technology China, US NSF, US DoE, US DHS, Norway research council, etc.  




## Some BFT/permissioned blockchain systems built
ByzID (SRDS 2014, Best Paper Candidate, BFT using small trusted components)<br>

BChain (OPODIS 2014, chain-based high-throughput BFT, used in Hyperledger Iroha, featured in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf">Hyperledger white paper</a>. In fact, this is the only BFT protocol that does not rely on PBFT in the Hyperledger framework.)

CBFT (SRDS 2016, BFT with confidentiality; if you want to achieve private smart contracts without using TEEs, you may be interested in the paper)

CP-BFT (DSN 2017, BFT with causal order without using threshold cryptography)

BEAT (CCS 2018, asynchronous BFT made practical; a family of five state-of-the-art asychronous BFT protocols; open-source implementation [<a href="https://github.com/fififish/beat.git">Code</a>] See review from  <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/11/26/beat-asynchronous-bft-made-practical/">Morning Paper</a>)

EPIC (DSN 2020, asynchronous BFT with adaptive security. Prior asynchronous BFT protocols defend against static adversary, while EPIC tolerates adaptive adversary. Code to be released soon)

<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/020">PACE (CCS 2022)</a> and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/021">WaterBear</a> are two new asynchronous BFT protocols

Recently, I am interested in building highly efficient partially synchronous BFT protocols, e.g., our DSN 2022 paper---Marlin, our Oakland 2022 Paper---Dyno, and Dashing and Star. 

I am also recently interested in designing and building systemss such as ACSS, AVSS, ADKG, and APSS, systems in synchronous settings, and MPC. 


## Openings!
I have many openings for PhDs, masters, and postdocs. 

Students/PhD students with computer science, cryptography, or security background are encouraged to send me an email!

We also welcome researchers and assistant professors to join our group and work together with us.

### Some Other Research and Industry Impacts

- I am one of the three main inventors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Zone">Norton Zone</a>, Symantec's Commercial Cloud Storage Platform. 

- Phil and I proved the security of ciphertext stealing for a NIST addendum. M. Dworkin. Recommendation for block cipher modes of operation: three variants of ciphertext stealing for CBC mode. Addendum to NIST Special Publication 800â€“38A. October 2010.

- <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/urs">Unique ring signatures and Monero</a>.

- A clean definition of online cipher was introduced in our RSA 2011 paper and widely used in subsequent online encryption and online authenticated encryption schemes (including
the CAESAR competition candidates). 

- One of the state of the art ABA protocols so far: CCS 2022 (Pillar). Pillar has on average 12 steps to terminate and assumes common coins and authenticated channels only. 

- The most communication-efficient RBC so far: PODC 2022. 

- The most communication-efficient AVID so far: PODC 2022 (BA).

I am happy to serve as PC members and spend time in helping review papers. 
More importantly, I really want to advertise and promote international conferences in China, 
and help exchange academic ideas and advance knowledge. (The world is somewhat more disconneted due to COVID. No?:)) 


I am certainly biased, but I am particularly interested and committed in promoting less established but high-quality conferences in China. 
Doing so may help these conferences more vigorous (e.g., by receiving 
more high-quality submissions), help researchers in China have more balanced research 
(now somewhat impacted by the CCF short list---some of those conferences not in the list, unfortunately, are ones with areas that are under-developed), 
and help researchers who published papers in these conferences get the recognization that they deserve.
